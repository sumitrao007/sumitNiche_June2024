- Typescript is Object Orientated Lang.
- Typescript is superset of javascript
- Developed By Mircosoft 2012
- It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C#) at Microsoft
its coding style is used like C++
- The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a scripting language
- ECMAScript standard + ECMAScript version6(JS) + Additional features(Opps Concept,module)=Typescript



Advantages
1 Strong static typing
       -TypeScript is a typed language, where we can specify the type of the variables, function parameters and object properties
inferred Type to mention Data type of Variable, if not mentioned Data type its by deafault take "any" Data type
2 Find Compile Time Error 
3 Supports 
  - Classess
  - Inheritance
  - interface
  - enum
  - Function Override
  - Function overloading 
	add(int a);
    add(int a,string str);
	add(int a,string str,int c){
		
	}

Disadvantage
- Browser Don't understand Typescript
	.ts +tsc (typescript compiler)=>.js (javascript)
	
- Generally TypeScript takes time to compile the code.
